# godot
outputs random Ace Attorney Godot quotes to the terminal

Also prints out an incredibely hot picture of godot into the terminal

it's also just really cool.

This is my first C++ project I made for fun. I'm still working on this, as I want to add in more quotes and perhaps eventually add in a gif for godot sipping his coffee.

# Instructions
Download this repo (git clone or just download the zip and extract it), and run the executable. You may have run `chmod +x` on it, I don't know. 
Auto Load it every time you load up a terminal: Edit your `.bashrc` and throw 'er in there. It's what I do!!
If you're a nerd like me, you can compile this yourself! I used `g++ -o godot DiegoArmando.cpp`, but you can use whatever you want. It's not a big project or anything, I'm sure your compiler will work...
As of right now, there is no windows compatibility. As this project is licensed under the GPL, you are completely free to modify and change this as you want to make it run on your OS! I just want it to work on my machine for my usecase.
