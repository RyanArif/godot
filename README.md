# godot
outputs random Ace Attorney Godot quotes to the terminal

Also prints out an incredibely hot picture of godot into the terminal

it's also just really cool.

This is my first C++ project I made for fun. I'm still working on this, as I want to add in more quotes and perhaps eventually add in a gif for godot sipping his coffee. I also want to get rid of the easily modifiable txt files, and go with a single file executable in the future (perhaps.)
