# godot
outputs random Ace Attorney Godot quotes to the terminal

Also prints out an incredibely hot picture of godot into the terminal

it's also just really cool.

This is my first C++ project I made for fun. I'm still working on this, as I want to add in more quotes and perhaps eventually add in a gif for godot sipping his coffee. I also want to get rid of the easily modifiable txt files, and go with a single file executable in the future (perhaps.)

# Instructions
Download this repo (git clone or just download the zip and extract it), and run the executable. You may have to chmod +x it, I don't know. 
If you're a nerd like me, you can compile this yourself! I used `g++ -o godot DiegoArmando.cpp`, but you can use whatever you want. It's not a big project or anything, I'm sure your compiler will work...
Also, you probably have to compile this yourself to run it on windows. Or maybe just rename the "godot" executable to "godot.exe" i don't know, I don't use windows.
